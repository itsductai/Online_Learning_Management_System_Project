    " **Mục tiêu**\n",
    " - Fine-tune mô hình T5 (seq2seq) cho bài toán Text-to-SQL trên Kaggle.\n",
    " - Dùng dataset công khai (b-mc2/sql-create-context, Clinton/Text-to-sql-v1, knowrohit07/know_sql),\n",
    " sau đó trộn, tiền xử lý (tokenize), huấn luyện, lưu mô hình.\n",
    " - Không thay đổi logic cốt lõi; chỉ bổ sung chú thích chi tiết.\n",
    "\n",
    " **Luồng chính**\n",
    " 1) Cài đặt thư viện → Import.\n",
    " 2) Nạp/ghép dataset có sẵn → lưu cache (merged_dataset).\n",
    " 3) Tiền xử lý (tokenize) → lưu cache (tokenized_datasets).\n",
    " 4) Kiểm thử zero-shot (baseline) trên model gốc.\n",
    " 5) Huấn luyện full fine-tune → lưu mô hình đã fine-tune.\n",
    " 6) Kiểm thử lại với mô hình fine-tuned + đánh giá (ROUGE) mẫu nhỏ.\n",
    " 7) Đóng gói mô hình (zip) để tải xuống / dùng về sau.\n",
    "\n",
    " **Đầu ra (sản phẩm)**\n",
    " - Thư mục model đã fine-tune: /kaggle/working/sql_t5_finetuned\n",
    " - Có thể nạp về app (FastAPI/Flask/.NET-bridge) bằng from_pretrained(\"/kaggle/working/sql_t5_finetuned\")."
